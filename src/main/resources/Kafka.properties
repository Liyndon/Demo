# 0, which means that the producer never waits for an acknowledgement
# from the broker (the same behavior as 0.7). This option provides the
# lowest latency but the weakest durability guarantees (some data will
# be lost when a server fails).
# 1, which means that the producer gets an acknowledgement after the
# leader replica has received the data. This option provides better
# durability as the client waits until the server acknowledges the
# request as successful (only messages that were written to the
# now-dead leader but not yet replicated will be lost).
# -1, which means that the producer gets an acknowledgement after all
# in-sync replicas have received the data. This option provides the
# best durability, we guarantee that no messages will be lost as long
# as at least one in sync replica remains.
